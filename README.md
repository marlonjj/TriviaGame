# TriviaGame
Howdy partners!

This project is a basic Math Trivia game I created during the third week of my coding bootcamp with Trilogy at UC Berkeley Extension

To start the game, press the 'Start Game' button. This will trigger a 20 second countdown in which you have to select true or false on whether the addition problem displayed is correct. There will be 10 questions, and upon submitting responses to 10 questions or running out of time, the game will end and display how many questions the player got correct.

This project was a learning experience for me to practice basic jQuery calls and understand radio buttons in html a bit more.


It is all created by yours truly, Marlon Jovez, with the inspiration of the program and our teacher, David Hallinan.
